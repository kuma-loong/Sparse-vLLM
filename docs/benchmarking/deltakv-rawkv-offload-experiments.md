# DeltaKV RawKV Offload Experiments

## 2026-07-05 - Prefill Compute vs RawKV Load Microbench

- Status: completed.
- Goal: measure when one-layer chunk prefill attention is long enough to cover loading one layer of historical Qwen2.5-7B raw KV from pinned CPU memory.
- Script: `scripts/profiling/bench_prefill_load_overlap.py`
- Output root: `/data2/haojitai/outputs/Sparse-vLLM/prefill_load_overlap_20260705`
- Detailed chunk-index report: `docs/benchmarking/deltakv-prefill-load-overlap-report.md`
- Hardware: local H100 80GB; GPU5/6/7 were used. GPU4 had about 52 GB already allocated and was not used.
- Shape: Qwen2.5-7B GQA attention, `q_heads=28`, `kv_heads=4`, `head_dim=128`, `bf16`; load time is one layer of K+V history; attention time uses FlashAttention with `q_len=chunk_size`, `kv_len=n+chunk_size`, `causal=True`.

| Chunk size | At n=900k: load ms | At n=900k: attention ms | Attention / load | Interpretation |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 512 | 34.55 | 23.17 | 0.67x | Too small to cover full-prefix load at long context. |
| 1024 | 34.51 | 38.05 | 1.10x | Near the long-context crossover. |
| 2048 | 34.64 | 75.31 | 2.17x | Covers load. |
| 4096 | 34.74 | 134.68 | 3.88x | Covers load. |
| 8192 | 34.09 | 269.83 | 7.91x | Covers load comfortably. |
| 16384 | 34.72 | 594.47 | 17.12x | Covers load comfortably. |
| 32768 | 35.35 | 1219.37 | 34.50x | Covers load comfortably. |
| 65536 | 33.29 | 2532.44 | 76.08x | Covers load comfortably. |
| 131072 | 33.24 | 5300.60 | 159.49x | Covers load comfortably. |

Conclusion: for realistic chunk sizes (`>=2048`, and especially the current `32768`/`65536` settings), raw H2D load is much shorter than chunk attention compute on H100. The earlier `prefetch=1` slowdown is therefore not explained by PCIe bandwidth; it points to implementation overhead such as synchronous CPU-side prefix reassembly or extra staging copies before attention. Very small chunks around `512` are the exception: load can dominate at long contexts.

Conclusion: chunked CPU RawKV storage is required for the 900k target. Contiguous pinned CPU backing store spends too much time on large per-layer allocations and writes; with chunked storage, DeltaKV reaches 1411.50 tok/s, above the 1379.39 tok/s target. The old CPU prefetch path was not a useful optimization: depth 1 drops to 1050.05 tok/s and depth 2 drops to 1132.92 tok/s while increasing memory. The end-to-end run still shows long non-token intervals from long-prefill offload restore/finalize work, so future tuning should profile those phases instead of only increasing chunk size.

## 2026-07-04 - LongBench Quality Regression

- Baseline run: `/data2/haojitai/outputs/Sparse-vLLM/deltakv_rawkv_offload_baseline_full_20260704_gpu5/sparsevllm_regression/deltakv_rawkv_offload_baseline_full_20260704_gpu5_quality`
- Failed intermediate run: `/data2/haojitai/outputs/Sparse-vLLM/deltakv_rawkv_after_chunked_full_20260704_gpu7/sparsevllm_regression/deltakv_rawkv_after_chunked_full_20260704_gpu7_quality`
- Final run: `/data2/haojitai/outputs/Sparse-vLLM/deltakv_rawkv_after_chunked_fix_quality_20260704_gpu7/sparsevllm_regression/deltakv_rawkv_after_chunked_fix_quality_20260704_gpu7_quality`

| Run | Status | Vanilla | DeltaKV | Delta vs baseline DeltaKV | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Baseline full quality | completed | 58.28 | 57.96 | 0.00 | Pre-change reference. |
| Intermediate ungated offload quality | failed quality gate | 58.28 | 9.38 | -48.58 | Long-prefill offload accidentally chunked ordinary LongBench prompts. |
| Final quality after offload threshold fix | completed | 58.28 | 57.96 | 0.00 | Restores full-prefill staging for prompts below 262144 tokens. |

Correctness conclusion: the raw-KV offload path must be gated to truly long prompts. The default threshold is `SPARSEVLLM_LONG_PREFILL_OFFLOAD_MIN_TOKENS=262144`; prompts below that keep the DeltaKV full-prefill staging semantics, while 900k prompts still use chunked long-prefill offload staging.
