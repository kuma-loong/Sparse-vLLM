## News
- [2024/10] 🔥 We released Quest support for the **Llama-3.1** and **Mistral-v0.3** model family.

## TL;DR
Quest is an efficient long-context LLM inference framework that leverages **query-aware sparsity** in KV cache to reduce memory movement during attention and thus boost throughput. 

## Abstract
As the demand for long-context large language models (LLMs) increases, models with context windows of up to 128k or 1M tokens are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the inference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This slowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention. Previous works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate the attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly depends on the query. 

To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware token criticality estimation algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in KV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query vectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest significantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show that Quest can achieve up to 7.03× self-attention speedup, which reduces inference latency by 2.23× while performing well on tasks with long dependencies with negligible accuracy loss.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo (also clone submodules)
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mit-han-lab/quest
cd quest
```
2. Install dependency libraries
```
conda create -yn quest python=3.10
conda activate quest

# Quest
pip install -e .

# Flash-Attention
pip install ninja packaging
pip install flash-attn==2.6.3 --no-build-isolation

# Install CMake (with version >= 3.26.4)
conda install cmake

# build libraft
cd kernels/3rdparty/raft
./build.sh libraft
```
3. Compile kernel correctness tests (optional).
```
cd kernels
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```
4. Build end-to-end operators with PyBind
```
# This will automatically build and link the operators
cd quest/ops
bash setup.sh
```
## Examples
We provide several examples to demonstrate the usage of Quest. These examples are implemented with the end-to-end integration of Quest operators, and can be executed with the following commands (please make sure you have setup all the operators):
```
python3 scripts/example_textgen.py
```
With example output of long-context summarization under LongChat-7B-v1.5-32K model:
